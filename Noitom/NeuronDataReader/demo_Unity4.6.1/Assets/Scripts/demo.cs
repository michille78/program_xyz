* 1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement (the “License”), Beijing Noitom Technologies Ltd. (“Noitom”) hereby grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, sublicenseable copyright license to use, reproduce, redistribute (subject to restrictions below), modify, and improve the software contained in this Perception Neuron Software Development Kit (“Perception Neuron SDK”), including, but not limited to, the samples, headers, libraries and source. This license is subject to the following terms and conditions:
* 1.1. This license includes the non-exclusive license and right to use (i) the Perception Neuron SDK to make applications, content, games and demos (collectively and generally referred to as “Developer Content”) that run using Perception Neuron hardware and which may incorporate the Perception Neuron SDK in whole or in part in binary or object code; and (ii) to use the Perception Neuron SDK to create derivative works of the Perception Neuron SDK itself (“Perception Neuron SDK Derivatives”), whether in source, binary, or object form, in whole or in part, including third party software unless otherwise noted.
* 1.2. Perception Neuron SDK Derivatives are further defined as source, binary or object code derived exclusively from the Perception Neuron SDK by you; provided, however, that Perception Neuron SDK Derivatives do not include the Developer Content (engines, utilities, applications, content, games or demos) which may be developed using the Perception Neuron SDK. By way of example a game or demo that is developed using the Perception Neuron SDK would not be a Perception Neuron SDK Derivative , nor would a utility or tool set in a pre-existing game engine that is adapted to work with the Perception Neuron SDK be a Perception Neuron SDK Derivative. By way of example, but not limitation, a Perception Neuron SDK Derivative is or would be: either (i) an adaptation of a utility or piece of code from the Perception Neuron SDK to improve efficiency; or(ii) an addition of code or improvement to the Perception Neuron SDK that adds functionality.
* 1.3 For the sake of clarification when you use the Perception Neuron SDK (including Perception Neuron SDK Derivatives) in or with Developer Content, you retain all rights to your Developer Content, and you have no obligations to share or license Developer Content (including your source and object code) to Noitom or any third parties; provided, however, Noitom retains all rights to the Perception Neuron SDK and the Perception Neuron SDK Derivatives that may be incorporated into your Developer Content.
* 2. You, the recipient and user of the Perception Neuron SDK, hereby agree and accept that that Noitom shall own all right, title and interest to the intellectual property rights, including, but limited to copyright, trademark and patent rights, to any Perception Neuron SDK Derivatives that you may create, and you hereby assign any and all such rights to such Perception Neuron SDK Derivatives to Noitom, subject to the following.
* 2.1 We hereby grant to you the a fully paid up, no-charge, royalty-free, world-wide, in perpetuity, non-exclusive right and license back to use these Perception Neuron SDK Derivatives solely in conjunction with the Perception Neuron SDK(or any components of the Perception Neuron SDK) and/or Developer Content on Noitom Products as set forth herein.
* 2.2 Furthermore, for the sake of clarification, Noitom and its assignees and licensees shall be free to use such Perception Neuron SDK Derivatives without any approval from you and without compensation or attribution to you.
* 2.3 You also agree upon Noitom’s request to provide the source and binary code of any Perception Neuron SDK Derivatives to Noitom. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS REQUEST IS THE BASIS FOR AUTOMATIC TERMINATION OF THIS LICENSE BY Noitom.
* 3. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, your license to redistribute and sublicense the Perception Neuron SDK and Perception Neuron SDK Derivatives is also expressly made subject to the following conditions:
* 3.1. You may sublicense and redistribute the source, binary, or object code of the Perception Neuron SDK in whole or in part by itself for no charge or as part of a for charge piece of Developer Content; provided, however, you may only license, sublicense or redistribute the source, binary or object code of Perception Neuron SDK in whole, and you may not license, sublicense or redistribute any portion or element of Perception Neuron SDK separately or in part (in either source, binary or object form). If you license, sublicense or redistribute Perception Neuron SDK Derivatives in and of themselves (not as a part of a piece of Developer Content) then you may only do that solely with and in conjunction with the Perception Neuron SDK. The Perception Neuron SDK, any Perception Neuron SDK Derivatives, and any Developer Content may only be used with Noitom approved Products and may not be used, licensed, or sublicensed to interface with software or hardware or other commercial motion capture products that are not authorized and approved by Noitom;
* 3.2. You must include with all such redistributed or sublicensed Perception Neuron SDK or Perception Neuron SDK Derivatives code the following copyright notice: “Copyright © 2014 Beijing Noitom Technologies Ltd. All rights reserved,” and include the list of conditions contained in this Section3, including the full text of the disclaimer in Section 3.6 below;
* 3.3. Neither the name of Beijing Noitom Technologies Ltd. nor the names of Beijing Noitom Technologies Ltd.’s contributors, licensors, employees, or contractors, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Perception Neuron SDK without specific prior written permission of Beijing Noitom Technologies Ltd.;
* 3.4. You must give any other recipients of the Perception Neuron SDK or any elements thereof, including Perception Neuron SDK Derivatives, a copy of this License as such recipients, licensees or sublicensees may only use the Perception Neuron SDK or any Perception Neuron SDK Derivatives or any elements thereof subject to the terms of this License and such recipients, licensees or sublicensees agreement and acceptance of this License with Perception Neuron (which will convey all rights to the recipients’ or licensees’ or sublicensees’ Perception Neuron SDK Derivatives to Noitom), and you must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files;
* 3.5. If the Perception Neuron SDK or a specific element thereof includes a “LICENSE” text file as part of its distribution (the “License Notice”), then any Perception Neuron SDK Derivatives that you distribute with the Perception Neuron SDK in whole or in part must include a readable copy of such attribution notices as are contained within the applicable License Notice file (excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Perception Neuron SDK Derivatives), in at least one of the following places: within a License Notice text file distributed as part of the Perception Neuron SDK Derivatives; within the source form documentation, if provided along with the Perception Neuron SDK Derivatives; or, within a display generated by the Perception Neuron SDK Derivatives, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. You must also include in the License Notice file for all Perception Neuron SDK Derivatives a copy of all notices (including any product liability or health and safety notices). The contents of the License Notice file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add your own attribution notices within Perception Neuron SDK Derivatives that you distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the License Notice text from the Perception Neuron SDK or any part thereof, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

* 6.	Failure to provide required notices or deliver source code and/or binary of Perception Neuron SDK Derivatives as set forth above.
* If you believe that you have been wrongfully terminated under this Section 8 with respect to material breach or with respect to these above conditions, you have the right to appeal the termination of this License under Section 14.
* 9. This License may be amended by Noitom on a prospective basis, and your usage of the License after such amendments or changes signifies your consent toad acceptance of any such amendments or changes on a going forward basis.
* 10. In the event any provision of this License is determined to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable by a court or other body of competent jurisdiction, this License shall be construed as if such invalid, prohibited or unenforceable provision has been more narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable.
